# Heap-Sort-Benchmarking
This code compares the perfomance of iterative and recursive heap sort algorithms using by comparing critical counts and execution time.

Each algorithm sorts 10 arrays of randomly-generated integers of size n, where n = 1 to n = 15,000. After sorting, a chart displays the average and standard deviation of critical operations counts and execution time for each array.
