# Heap-Sort-Benchmarking
This code compares the perfomance of iterative and recursive heap sort algorithms by comparing critical counts and execution time. Each algorithm sorts 10 arrays of randomly-generated integers of size n, where n = 1 to n = 15,000. After sorting, a chart displays the following for each array: 

  - average number of critical count operations
  - standard deviation of critical count operations 
  - average execution time
  - standard deviation of execution times
